Tooltip: Export Assembly as DXF
Author: Lucas Johansson
Year: 2024

This SolidWorks macro exports all sheet metal flat patterns from an assembly to DXF files, saved in a new folder named DXF within the assembly's root folder.

Features
Automated DXF Export: Exports flat patterns for all sheet metal components in an assembly or part.
File Naming: Customizable file naming using a template.
Configuration Handling: Supports multiple configurations within parts and assemblies.
Duplicate Handling: Avoids re-exporting existing DXF files if specified.
Installation
Download the macro file and save it to your local machine.
Open SolidWorks and go to Tools > Macro > Run....
Navigate to the saved macro file and select it.
Usage
Open the desired assembly or part document in SolidWorks.
Run the macro using Tools > Macro > Run... and select Assem2dxf.v3.
The macro will create a DXF folder in the root directory of the assembly and save the flat pattern DXF files there.
Configuration
Constants
SKIP_EXISTING_FILES: Set to True to avoid overwriting existing DXF files.

Example Output
If the assembly file is located at C:\Projects\MyAssembly.SLDASM and contains a sheet metal part Part1.SLDPRT with a flat pattern named Flat-Pattern1, the resulting DXF file might be named:

C:\Projects\DXFs\Part1_Flat-Pattern1_Default_.dxf

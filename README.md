# Assem2dxf.v3 SolidWorks Macro

## Overview
This SolidWorks macro, `Assem2dxf.v3`, automates the process of exporting all sheet metal flat patterns from an assembly to DXF format. It creates a new folder named `DXF` in the assembly's root folder and saves each flat pattern as a separate DXF file.

## Features
- Export sheet metal flat patterns.
- Include hidden edges and bend lines in DXF export.
- Handle merged coplanar faces and include library features and forming tools.

## Usage
1. Open the assembly or part document in SolidWorks.
2. Run the `Assem2dxf.v3` macro.
3. All sheet metal flat patterns will be exported to a new `DXF` folder in the assembly's root directory.
